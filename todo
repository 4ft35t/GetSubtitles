util.py has many unnecessary functions which can be organized into one class, one that manipulates Subtitle, decompressing, guessing/choosing and extracting single file from Subtitle.
Maybe these functions can be added to Subtitle. After passing SearchResult to Downloader.download_file, Subtitle in SearchResult can be filled with file data also its datatype.

Can start from main.py:220
